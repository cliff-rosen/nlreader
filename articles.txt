Dear friends,

Progress on LLM-based agents that can autonomously plan out and execute sequences of actions has been rapid, and I continue to see month-over-month improvements. Many projects attempt to take a task like “write a report on topic X” and autonomously take actions such as browsing the web to gather information to synthesize a report.

AI agents can be designed to take many different types of actions. Research agents (like many projects built on AutoGPT (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW9Xms3H5Vs7W5pqPlH3G5JrNW2QY3Nh5blspSN1c6sqP3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3pRVCPhmz621c5sW1vQ9PD4mb4bKW40cw4f7xQJhCW3CfqjS4JXK6hW37t95v17J07JW56wtcq60L44gW8TTLDw4G39wPW2QdrFY2vBZ1lW4czk9Z2zt_ZSN3BVHQxg2QsQW5bgfjn1Qkc0rW8_F4-_5b74fcW1-42rq2Rc0zMW2Z0y0T6dBy-GW3Pfchg7PGKl6W6VB3KM52xqCzW2PWZK08vt2MwN89M_7P2P-LmN7VgB5ZHYr4BW4rMkXf79FnsLW6zMZG722jh0BW7QR55r5bH7TTW60zLHm5hJRdwW1WXwzh1X_7Ktf6spkvM04 ) , GPTresearcher (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW9Xms3H5Vs7W5pqPlH3G5JrNW2QY3Nh5blspSN1c6sqP3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3kLW2scglb5x_bj8N4hMCpytxLX5W14xDk18D7zl2W3_p2f88Lgp-SMR3z3FQzrnNMc8HxCcYgf4VK6Qsc1C19bRW3Mtp244d4NLNW2LVNpk6drKV-W1GLVvy8NmchFW2WvG7x1JR01fW6fbS-s2qKHFfW49Yb2M1grc_NW5VfNQ22qbtNDW3-4MdN33zk7ZW5rm_Yk14rRQ2W249qsy3GnlWFW2ZGW5W87t1RdVn4FDy3Q-74hW76K1wc3rHxzgVth-qP8lnJ79W7dbxXF1MTgbjW3prw_p7Zt4vlW4JxG9b5RkgRCf4c8sHs04 ) , or STORM (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW9Xms3H5Vs7W5pqPlH3G5JrNW2QY3Nh5blspSN1c6sqv3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3nRW1sCH182vBBvMW3MBF273HJn2ZW14Gx0H5nVksLW7sCqWj3bMlMNVm5mdj4jPq1VVjL3Rg5Tr6SDW3P5S_x7XQ73-W2ZXyHj76YZRzW7TCqyT1rxBhvW5hw0_q7cw4SfW6mBfTv6gZbtvW6Sp4hk2HRl7NMSbfyXz5nHjW86d1-p9dwq-kN2vWdRwzc3wKVZQS717d8xNyW3fN_Dq6Bw232W8l3l-23NbwTLW11FPfG9cxWsWW6khHzK404h-KW2pbMNn1Wl8BgVn06ZK7rftYxf6vK9rY04 ) ) search the web and fetch web pages. A sales representative agent might dispatch a product to a user. An industrial automation agent might control a robot.

So far, I see agents that browse the web progressing much faster because the cost of experimentation is low, and this is key to rapid technical progress. It’s cheap to fetch a webpage, and if your agent chooses poorly and reads the wrong page, there’s little harm done. In comparison, sending a product or moving a physical robot are costly actions, which makes it hard to experiment rapidly. Similarly, agents that generate code (that you can run in a sandbox environment) are relatively cheap to run, leading to rapid experimentation and progress.

Although today’s research agents, whose tasks are mainly to gather and synthesize information, are still in an early phase of development, I expect to see rapid improvements. ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Gemini can already browse the web, but their online research tends to be limited; this helps them get back to users quickly. But I look forward to the next generation of agents that can spend minutes or perhaps hours doing deep research before getting back to you with an output. Such algorithms will be able to generate much better answers than models that fetch only one or two pages before returning an answer.

Even when experimentation is quick, evaluation remains a bottleneck in development. If you can try out 10 algorithm variations quickly, how do you actually pick among them? Using an LLM to evaluate another LLM's output is common practice, but prompting an LLM to give very accurate and consistent evaluations of text output is a challenge. Any breakthroughs here will accelerate progress!

An exciting trend has been a move toward multi-agent systems. What if, instead of having only a single agent, we have one agent to do research and gather information, a second agent to analyze the research, and a third to write the final report? Each of these agents can be built on the same LLM using a different prompt that causes it to play a particular, assigned role. Another common design pattern is to have one agent write and a second agent work as a critic to give constructive feedback to the first agent to help it improve. This can result in much higher-quality output. Open-source frameworks like Microsoft’s AutoGen (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW9Xms3H5Vs7W5pqPlH3G5JrNW2QY3Nh5blspSN1c6sqv3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3pdV3rYRD3TcHqQW61SDRr3mmgVPW5G9dfb1vTJVRW3xJTH_5hHJbQW31pg8n15vcgwW5qKn5Z5kd-S5W3XDldB1RF3fQW4kJcqN62wvrVW2XKLYM7jKrb4V3Y5VH267JBWMSSscNdVprDVddBh91R_Mx-N1TJznk6btHdN8H_QYxnNXkbW6V5K826X0jmQW4Z8tsG2V4JvvW7Jcv6f8G9909W8klw875jCyqgN1YqPhfYR3RdW4BxRX-7Mrn6-TP8ry6SXFP3W6Rx0YF2yJ9Qjf999lyl04 ) , Crew AI (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW9Xms3H5Vs7W5pqPlH3G5JrNW2QY3Nh5blspSN1c6sqb3prCCW69sMD-6lZ3mLMFhlnQKHSD3W36T0pB3F9ZKsVYPwq410z-rfW58XBc71jrM_cW1hRp4D6VCVf0W54_nC66Vrl_JVBvRD56Jyl_HW1R21h542b6FQVb2fN1110M5tW8RsT9P7mXD3DN5qsytHmBR2XW7f_8Nz27Z-JPW2GdSmb97T_ZqVpJfx78fqLX6W69l61x9dR68lW3mTSxw7kKfKQW1PS9Zf7QYXQMW5_pvZf95F0fMW6SPd757Nc2_0W5vvylp6nNr99f2XCcrb04 ) , and LangGraph (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW9Xms3H5Vs7W5pqPlH3G5JrNW2QY3Nh5blspSN1c6sqv3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3nzW73Bkhp4z23wGW7XHMhK85FG7vVHPbl01jcPkWW9k6nBr9gXH9nW1z6-yP4_hRkkW3fTbg17bJ3cHW4tvw5b49_xSrW3KTSqD1KbhVxW7lvrJ31PdbskW8BMDgg4XCtCKW1-FMN_57fkW7W5LV8Lh2n23Q4W6lxR3L1cCzx5W7PbGl06DQNFqW4dw05W2LMW5DW2DdN6s53cHqKW58wDc95p5DwzW770FLz6MPcVwW898gpQ7RcxKhW4RPw437NqGs7VvTvf91Zc0XjW4YZRZG3lFxd0f6-yGDK04 ) are making it easier for developers to program multiple agents that collaborate to get a task done.

I’ve been playing with many agent systems myself, and I think they are a promising approach to architecting intelligent systems. A lot of progress has been made by scaling up LLMs, and this progress no doubt will continue. But big ideas are sometimes made up of many, many little ideas. (For example, you might arrive at an important mathematical theorem via lots of little derivation steps.) Today’s LLMs can reason and have lots of “little ideas” in the sense that they take in information and make basic inferences. Chain-of-thought prompting (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW9Xms3H5Vs7W5pqPlH3G5JrNW2QY3Nh5blspSN1c6sqv3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3pcW6kbFjf8HNrzkW20CJ2V5GmlHQW7Xp9w_4QQB4rW28_fhz1M2KtVW5n9c0X2mbFNYW96knQ38dZkclW5cHh7z47MN6pW8668305xMkNTW8TlhqC7n15SgW8XPrTW2qK3F4W5hP9zB6zf_wkW1DHlVR2J6RLnW5y1ngD2JCJ_FW9j2YXM8xJx01W8pt6PY3yd0G-W4kPn3R1VYgsjW8LM8dH5FpnTMW4MDw_h8Q_FRyW3-XVc57JSrfCW3NcT3T4GRh79V4Nn6D61kJrFW2c3H5z51lb4Bf7zNqDv04 ) shows that guiding an LLM to think step-by-step — that is, to string together many basic inferences — helps it to answer questions more accurately than asking it to leap to a conclusion without intermediate steps.

Agent programming models are a promising way to extend this principle significantly and guide LLMs to have lots of little ideas that collectively constitute bigger and more useful ideas.

Model specs: The new models’ parameter counts, architectures, and training methods are undisclosed. Like the earlier, open source Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B, they can process 32,000 tokens of input context.

- Mistral Large achieved 81.2 percent on the MMLU (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW9Xms3H5Vs7W5pqPlH3G5JrNW2QY3Nh5blspSN1c6sr43prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3l2W5G5y0s17pcCQW7JMJ3M2Rc93NW998Gj918c2PLW36KPtD3W9hltV3cWZZ7bw1cPW1qbSkH2wMXMZW6LWm3Y2tjQjZW8DdbXp8vm2TpW2jMRKp4kC46FW3q29pp2Dv_p8W1H7BkZ23-8QGW7x18hJ26vLWhN309HwmTfgqdW1b9f1S95MNy6VG-4Jg45wbGFW2VhKdq8Sy_jGW1fw00Q2ymLryW4FtD-88ghH_KW2KFRPr77pClRW5l4CFW8Pw_j_W52q06W46jMGrW4HtXZF2D4h-xW92Cf0x6K5vrKW8B5fC16yQdRmW4q_8TS88SFYmVWRJBm3zMTgsf3M1SdR04 ) benchmark, outperforming Anthropic’s Claude 2, Google’s Gemini Pro, and Meta’s Llama 2 70B, though falling short of GPT-4. Mistral Small, which is optimized for latency and cost, achieved 72.2 percent on MMLU.
- Both models are fluent in French, German, Spanish, and Italian. They’re trained for function calling and JSON-format output.

- Mistral AI and Microsoft will collaborate to train bespoke models for customers including European governments.

Behind the news: Mistral AI was founded in early 2023 by engineers from Google and Meta. The French government has touted the company as a home-grown competitor to U.S.-based leaders like OpenAI.

However, other French lawmakers support (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW9Xms3H5Vs7W5pqPlH3G5JrNW2QY3Nh5blspSN1c6srn3prCCW8wLKSR6lZ3kWVShL9c3shq3XW7grKFs1pZ3hBW1FKXjQ231YMGW1R2zry1YtlTGW570g8V5-MpDxW4WxGWs6_kx24W8mzZb175BPkzT9VLn5zWY4cW8Dtv-t7sGhNlW6CZKJY2G-ZGgN127NrmG4G5mW4Q5ZGm2cMv63W99NM_n5TD-VyW5hF-H271pjlxW2CFCD32xSdSTW9l3rbY7kGnYPW4d3B_R70wRczW63qKNZ8LdwPqW6h6Hpb6FvhSsW8SDP749bsPzcW4p8JTy8KHnk3W7W3XFY7PqZlTW51Lh7n1D3R-1W2pv3Sx3g_jrHW8pLC0p3qw7hsW2jKCZz27ghbGW8w6BbP5BtSWHVmLlVX3ySPFTf8PrqH804 ) the relationship.

Why it matters: The partnership between Mistral AI and Microsoft gives the startup crucial processing power for training large models and greater access to potential customers around the world. It gives the tech giant greater access to the European market. And it gives Azure customers access to a high-performance model that’s tailored to Europe’s unique regulatory environment.

We’re thinking: Mistral AI has made impressive progress in a short time, especially relative to the resources at its disposal as a startup. Its partnership with a leading hyperscaler is a sign of the tremendous processing and distribution power that remains concentrated in the large, U.S.-headquartered cloud companies.

Robot Chemist

A robot outperformed human chemists at synthesizing chemicals.

What’s new: Researchers at University of Amsterdam built RoboChem (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW9Xms3H5Vs7W5pqPlH3G5JrNW2QY3Nh5blspSN1c6sqP3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3mmW6tN7X78c2L-qW14V6qk4c42qKW2nf9jF78f514W2Y-c-V8kTsVQW4R6vwt9jbnkSW4h9vzt8Q74jZW8Cnv535RLRf6W4LFZLJ8ZpkHvW3QhyQd7tYMHbW5XNZ0p1dB77lW7zFJ683z-SgmW14Ndz47CJ9JzW1h5P5k79dWkmN3qzC-M2hh_vW2Gt5qf91p61xW4tf4v52427LGW1J2DVJ6p5twBW1t1Pdt2MD4sHW7RYZ4D2VH6v9W7dlz8W53wWJvW4Wwkf129Frp5W4qgzvd2tSXr4W3LFJPL2N5W--V1J63P4pCpJrf4NCQ0H04 ) , an integrated robotic system that learned to design light-activated chemical reactions while achieving optimal yields and throughput.

How it works: RoboChem includes a computer that runs a machine learning model and a set of automated lab instruments including a liquid handler, syringe pumps, and a photochemical reactor, all enclosed in an airtight vacuum chamber. Given a set of reagents and resulting product, RoboChem aimed to find conditions that maximize the yield (the ratio of the amount of a product synthesized to the potential amount, expressed as a percentage) and throughput (rate of synthesis) in the fewest experimental runs. It followed a 3-part cycle: (i) determine experimental conditions (amounts and concentrations of the given reagents, intensity of light, and time spent in the reactor), (ii) combine the reagents under those conditions, and (iii) evaluate the yield and throughput via a spectrometer.

- RoboChem learned how to find the best conditions for each reaction using a Gaussian process, which provides a function and uncertainty estimate for variables to be maximized (in this case, yield and throughput) given the values of other variables (the experimental conditions). Given a set of reagents and 6 to 20 sets of random conditions, RoboChem ran the reactions, measured the results, and updated the Gaussian process.
- RoboChem chose new conditions based on which parts of the Gaussian process’s function had the highest uncertainty and which parts were most likely to produce the highest yield and throughput. RoboChem ran the reaction, measured the results, and updated the Gaussian process.
- It repeated this cycle until it achieved an author-defined throughput, yield, or number of experiments. It returned the conditions with the highest throughput and yield.

Results: Robochem executed reactions to produce 18 substances. In all cases, it found experimental conditions that had either higher throughput and yield, or higher throughput and nearly equivalent yield, than the best conditions previously known. In one reaction, RoboChem achieved yield of 58 percent and throughput of 95.6 g/Lh (gram yield per liter in the reactor per hour), while previous work had achieved 45 percent and 2.8 g/Lh. In another reaction, RoboChem achieved 81 percent and 1720 g/Lh, where previous best results achieved 82 percent and 3 g/Lh — 1 percent lower yield but 573 times greater throughput.

Behind the news: In 2020, researchers at the University of Liverpool trained (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW9Xms3H5Vs7W5pqPlH3G5JrNW2QY3Nh5blspSN1c6sr43prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3p_W7-HLtB8sw3npW3R8mxX7wZSfFW38d-Cz72R-XBW5Xb8mJ61d_2dW2QSB493ZMZwsW83N46g53bxd3W5Q31jq2Jj4wKW6dP2kX4nmT_qVjsq3H2M6GGcW52Dhfg7vPLdsW2vmx6B4mrSRcW5RmFGd8FmB8VW4bCmm317tr6xW8qF_s45DQfL7V29qNC4Fgw8BW8qz24x6DzzqFW2rmTzn2PmR5SW1_SlGw3p2PFfW22c5ch8f986HN3vZ_QpTqqYhN8h_zLTnvdqSW66DRTl32PtVzW2QHF0t2sJDPBW6cfmC76zp0KKW6zxXvl4Wd0pxW6HstWH7fQqv2f52_T5204 ) a mobile robot arm to navigate a chemistry lab, mix chemicals, and operate equipment. That robot used a similar optimization method. However, the Amsterdam robot is much less expensive and proved itself in a wider range of experiments.

Why it matters: The authors believe that RoboChem could dramatically increase lab productivity at lower cost in time and money. The light-activated reactions they focused on have applications in fields including pharmaceuticals, household chemicals, and renewable energy.

We’re thinking: These researchers clearly are in their element.

Behind the news: Google has a rich history of open source AI projects including AlphaFold, TensorFlow, several versions of BERT and T5, and the massive Switch. Lately, though, its open source efforts have been overshadowed by open large language models (LLMs) from Meta, Microsoft, and Mistral.ai. LLMs small enough to run on a laptop have opened open source AI to an expanding audience of developers.

Why it matters: Gemma raises the bar for models of roughly 7 billion parameters. It delivers exceptional performance in a relatively small parameter counts, expanding the options for developers who are building on top of LLMs.

We’re thinking: Gemma confirms Google’s commitment to open source and outperforms top open models of equal size. It’s likely to spur further innovation, especially in AI for edge devices (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW9Xms3H5Vs7W5pqPlH3G5JrNW2QY3Nh5blspSN1c6sr43prCCW7Y8-PT6lZ3nbN4Hzl4sVb8bvN5_Ygj775DqdW5rF_TL4TSpFfW1_WmTm7p3s6jW4rKF8F3pHY6gW4_y10B84TvHPW3RgPsv6P1TYrW93qcYm3VhctRW5Cn9v15hNS8HW6NNMhK7nT7q_W7KT0nN5ZkzV8VG7Xbc3sJyv4W7PfPnq3R_9mQW75PnL_8Vzw-4W6YlVWn70GLbKN2S6BpXxT7QbW2JMCpC7r8gc6V5rQkk7LqGmCV3nnl0383kDjW91Xpz45-NKzzW4rwzJb2fRKqGW30kB1N5_bspTW1ygsNH7-8W-rN4c8WsFDTJ-KW1k2jsD3Kx_NZN7ntKZr273llf8DcSFM04 ) , and keep the Google name in front of enterprising open source developers.

Schooling Language Models in Math

Large language models are not good at math. Researchers devised a way to make them better.

What's new: Tiedong Liu and Bryan Kian Hsiang Low at the National University of Singapore proposed a method to fine-tune large language models for arithmetic tasks (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW9Xms3H5Vs7W5pqPlH3G5JrNW2QY3Nh5blspSN1c6sqv3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3kRW30LFQy5M5NNlN6QnDXwZjFfFW68fTP03x745pW72Rc4J93m97CW6cv5Sb7DvYJ4W4Jyp4j2M3LZmW19Pd7Q4F-jsxVw0_DV80GJl7W1xRpFZ4kMlgsVnLp6Z8y_HLQW55btVz3wl1XkW9055k026pgFtVKQWDg69cmW1N91LYh_HDMKMW8PWcpG2vxBMhW5B2GFP5w-ZyvW2QkqgN5rS3zRW2-_kmx47RZWlW8VGg1H6gf4zWW6v188q6RdvH1N65zhRnr1t9_N8C1WYbzYNRPf33C_-404 ) .

Key insight: Large language models (LLMs) do fairly well at addition and subtraction as well as multiplication and division by single digits or by powers of 10. They’re less adept at the more challenging tasks of multiplication and division of larger numbers. One way to perform these tasks well is to divide them into simpler subtasks. For example, a relatively easy way to multiply two large numbers like 123 and 321 is to

- Split one number into decimal places (123 becomes 100 + 20 + 3)
- Multiply the other number by each of these (100 * 321 + 20 * 321 + 3 * 321)
- Add the resulting products to arrive at the solution (32100 + 6420 + 963 = 39483)

A similar technique exists for division. Together, these approaches can enable LLMs to perform more complicated mathematical tasks.

How it works: The authors built GOAT (a model GOod at Arithmetic Tasks) by fine-tuning LLaMA (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW9Xms3H5Vs7W5pqPlH3G5JrNW2QY3Nh5blspSN1c6sqv3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3mcW7CRT_c7bg96DW2LG14h4gJKHbW6ctB2118FXyqN6BBY8ZKWStDN5NRN3p3Dl7KW1K2dH02f8FJcW9j72j258M5pCW95P6Jl6H-v6cW2cQxRB8-qs7gW8txS5L4hTHXdW7KzTw91YzllBW1JbbF724WxMJVvBPwq6s33KqW8kXqj81cqdWcW3KBM_V1Hy087VFYpjV5KhVGjW1Bp7wT3YG5gQW4qJHrh3561ZZVNKrWG2LPQS3W4l2XJB9gxJg4N7NxmNqPkDgGW7pph1G6Xq_cXf5NXDVP04 )  on a synthetic dataset that comprised 1 million examples of arithmetic operations on integers that were divided into steps for easier calculation.

- The prompts were simple instructions like “Calculate 397 x 4429” or “I would appreciate it if you could assist me in calculating 1463456 + 2107”.
- The answers were either numbers (for the simpler operations) or chains of reasoning (for multiplications and divisions of larger numbers). For example, if the prompt was “Calculate 24x79”, the target was “24 * 79 = 24 * (70 + 9) = 24 * 70 + 24 * 9 = 1680 + 216 = 1896”.
- To create these chains, the authors wrote a Python script. For multiplication, the script randomly generated two numbers, split one number into decimal places, multiplied the second number by each of those terms, then added the products. It followed a similar procedure for division.

Results: The authors compared GOAT and GPT-4 on BIGBench (https://info.deeplearning.ai/e3t/Ctc/LX+113/cJhC404/VW9Xms3H5Vs7W5pqPlH3G5JrNW2QY3Nh5blspSN1c6sqv3prCCW6N1vHY6lZ3nrW450L6M31BpggW6M8Pzs2mM6JwW6j50-d88mk9pW200TFK1Qn0F6W3D0Gb39cLWXXVSBh_66zXQDWW6BJ9_t8TnWQJW3qLj5Z7kZlsCVpgBnB2hCh-9VFDCFB8LNR4gVgLq0K3PM1MjN4_Pm9cx3YLtW5ZDvBG3pJQyTW73L6tB4CR3JcVJyM3K5jBdtnW5prN9G7BTD2NV43vk55PmGr6W8VZ_CR5VYsCZW93BZS46gpFWRVkGpbR8M_kGdW2DlPP21plNC0W4dKfNb2Q7YFbf8txNwv04 ) , which contains arithmetic operations on integers up to five digits. GOAT performed either on par with or better than GPT-4 for all operations. Specifically, GPT-4 struggled to multiply and divide large numbers. Multiplying 5-digit numbers, GPT-4 achieved 0 percent accuracy, while GOAT achieved 96.7 percent. Dividing five-digit numbers, GPT-4 achieved 53.4 percent, while GOAT achieved 96.5 percent. GOAT also performed better than other LLMs (Bloom, GPT-NeoX, OPT, and Pythia) that had been fine-tuned in the same way. The authors attribute this to the fact that LLaMA generates a separate token for each digit (and does not learn tokens that represent multiple digits), while the other models learn tokens for multiple digits (for example, separate tokens for 748, 74, and 7).

Why it matters: LLMs have latent mathematical knowledge that can be unlocked by thoughtful fine-tuning.

We’re thinking: Humans, too, aren’t great at multiplying or dividing numbers directly — but give us a pencil and paper so we can work things out step by step, and we’re much better.

****ArtPrompt: ASCII Art-based Jailbreak Attacks against Aligned
LLMs****

**What's New?**

New ASCII-based art prompts were used to jailbreak Large Language Models
(LLMs), showing that safety alignment solely based on semantics is not
enough to ensure LLM safety.

The work shows that five LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, Claude and
Llama2) struggle to recognize prompts provided in the form of ASCII art.
This is the base of the ArtPrompt attack that can effectively and
efficiently induce undesired behaviors from all five LLMs. 

**Problem**

* Safety is critical to the usage of LLMs, and various techniques have
been developed to strengthen LLM Safety. However, all these methods are
based on text and semantics and none consider other forms of textual
information, such as ASCII art.

* All five models tested struggle to recognize ASCII art. It is a form
of text-based art that is used to convey information in a more creative
way.

**Breakthrough: **

* Using LLMs 

**weakness in recognizing ASCII art**, a new jailbreak method called
ArtPrompt was developed and tested on all five models studied.

* 

**ArtPrompt** is based on the observations that substituting words
likely to trigger rejection by LLMs with ASCII art increases the
probability of bypassing safety measures. When the prompt given to LLMs
contains information encoded by ASCII art, LLMs may excessively focus on
completing the recognition task, overlooking safety alignment
considerations.

* First, a 

**word mask** is generated, then an 

**ASCII art generator** is used to substitute the masked word.

**Contribution**:

* 

**ViTC Benchmark** : A new Vision-in-Text Challenge benchmark is
proposed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in recognizing prompts
that cannot be solely interpreted by semantics.

* 

**Evaluation on five models**: When tested using this new benchmark, all
five models tested (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, Claude and Llama2) see their
performance deteriorate significantly.

****OpenAI responds to Elon Musk's Lawsuit****

**What's New?**

OpenAI responded to Elon Musk's lawsuit by sharing some private emails
between them. These emails discuss the idea of changing OpenAI from a
nonprofit organization to a for-profit one because they needed more
money to work on AGI, which is a type of AI that can do anything a human
can. 

In the emails, Musk suggested combining OpenAI with Tesla and wanted to
have the main control. OpenAI did not agree because they believed it was
important for their mission that no single person had all the control.

The emails show that Musk supported a bigger funding goal than
originally planned. He said, "We need to go with a much bigger number
than $100M to avoid sounding hopeless... I will cover whatever anyone
else doesn't provide." 

However, disagreements arose between Musk and OpenAI, especially about
sharing their technology with everyone. In a 2016 email, Ilya Sutskever
from OpenAI mentioned, "as we get closer to building AI, it will make
sense to start being less open," and Musk replied, "Yup."

The issue also involves Musk's claim that after OpenAI teamed up with
Microsoft, it stopped sharing its AI work as openly as before. OpenAI
has mentioned that it raised less than $45 million from Musk, which is
less than the $1 billion he initially said he would provide. 

But, they also got more than $90 million from other people to help their
research. This situation has started a big debate about how to manage AI
development and share it with the public.

READ ARTICLE 

****TOP PAPERS****

Training Neural Networks from Scratch with Parallel Low-Rank Adapters
---------------------

This paper introduces LoRA-the-Explorer (LTE), a novel optimization
algorithm that extends low-rank adaptation (LoRA) methods to the
pre-training of neural networks, aiming to address the computational,
memory, and communication limitations faced by current deep learning
model scalability.

By enabling parallel training of multiple low-rank heads across
computing nodes with minimal need for synchronization, LTE offers a
solution for efficient model training on lower-memory devices and in
bandwidth-constrained environments.

Disentangled 3D Scene Generation with Layout Learning
---------------------

The paper introduces a novel method for generating 3D scenes
disentangled into their component objects without supervision. The
method optimizes multiple Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), each
representing a separate object, and composites these objects into scenes
that are encouraged to match the distribution of images generated by the
text-to-image model. 

The approach, termed layout learning, demonstrates new capabilities in
text-to-3D content creation, and outperforms current methods.

Dynamical Regimes of Diffusion Models
---------------------

The paper analyzes generative diffusion models using statistical
physics,  identifying key stages in this process and explaining how
and when models go from randomness to structured outcomes ('speciation'
and 'collapse' transitions). It offers a framework to understand the
curse of dimensionality in diffusion models.

Alignment Researcher Amanda Askell from Anthropic has broken down the
unique features of the system prompt used in the new Claude 3. 

This prompt includes special instructions for Claude to recognize its
identity, its creation by Anthropic, and the current date. It aims to
minimize biases, ensuring the AI maintains neutrality and avoids any
form of stereotyping. The prompt encourages concise responses and guides
Claude in handling a variety of topics within socially accepted
boundaries.

**Our Report:** The OpenAI board has issued a statement dismissing all claims made by Elon Musk in his recent lawsuit (_which declares they’ve breached their contractual agreement by pursuing profits instead of the original nonprofit mission, that he originally helped fund_).

🔑 **Key Points: **

* The board's statement maintains that since its inception in 2015, it has **raised less than $45M from Musk**, despite his initial commitment to provide as much as $1B in funding. 

* It argues that **transitioning to a for-profit structure was essential to secure the funding and resources** needed to develop superior intelligence AI systems.

* It claims that **Musk agreed with this, but wanted “absolute control” of the company**, which OpenAI refuted, feeling that no one person should have full control.

* Plus, it used examples of **how its technology empowers people in places like Kenya and India to prove its commitment to developing safe AI **while promoting wider access to its tools. 

🤨 **Why you should care: **The outcome of the ongoing battle between Musk and OpenAI could have serious ramifications on the direction and pace of AI development and change the balance of power among the key players within the industry.

 HOW AI COULD DISRUPT HOLLYWOOD (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI advancements like OpenAI's Sora and other platforms are enhancing
video production, potentially streamlining Hollywood's expensive and
complex filmmaking process. These tools raise questions about the
future of creative roles and the industry's ability to adapt to AI's
increasing capabilities in scripting, scoring, and editing films.
Hollywood faces a paradigm shift akin to the music industry's digital
transformation, with a mix of optimism and concern for the impact on
traditional filmmaking.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 RESEARCHY QUESTIONS: A NEW QUESTION ANSWERING DATASET (25 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Language models are now exceptionally skilled at answering questions.
As a result, most existing benchmarks have been saturated. There is a
new type of question, dubbed 'researchy', which is open-ended and
requires multiple steps. This particular dataset is mined from search
engine queries. It contains cases where GPT-4 struggled to answer
queries. 

 BOOSTING TEXT-TO-VIDEO QUALITY WITH UNIVERSAL CONTROL (3 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 UniCtrl introduces a new approach to enhancing semantic consistency
and motion quality in videos created by text-to-video models. It
improves video realism and coherence without the need for extra
training by using cross-frame self-attention and motion injection
techniques. 

 SEARCHING VIDEOS WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 VTG-GPT offers a novel GPT-based method for accurately identifying
specific segments in videos using natural language queries without the
need for training or fine-tuning. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 MOBILECLIP: FAST TEXT AND IMAGE MODEL (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 MobileClip runs 7x faster with the same performance as OpenAI’s
original CLIP model. It can be used on-device for various vision and
language tasks.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CLAUDE 3 IS THE MOST HUMAN AI YET (10 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Anthropic's release of Claude 3, a large language model comparable to
GPT-4, stands out not for its benchmark tests or cost efficiency, but
for its uniquely human-like, creative, and naturalistic interaction
quality, making it a significant advancement in AI's ability to
partner creatively with writers. 

 LICENSING AI MEANS LICENSING THE WHOLE ECONOMY (2 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Regulating AI like a tangible product is misguided because AI is a
broad process involving statistical methods, and overseeing its use
across all companies would be impractical. Targeted regulation for
specific misuses, similar to existing approaches for programming or
email abuses, is more effective given AI's impending ubiquity in the
economy. 

 EFFICIENT MODEL FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGE TASKS (26 MINUTE READ) [23]

Welcome, humans. 

The pace of AI so far in 2024 is relentless, with the releases of Sora, Gemini 1.5 Pro, AND Claude 3 all happening within a month. Spoiler alert: it only escalates from here.

As lovers of meditation, here's a quick one so you don't lose your sh*t: deep breath in…hold for a moment…deep breath out. Let this newsletter be your anchor of calm and clarity in a world of chaos. 🧡

**Here’s what you need to know about AI today:**

* Claude 3 reviews continue to impress.

* We show you how to replicate any writing style/voice with Claude 3.

# Here’s how we’re using Claude 3 to write better. 

We’ve been immersed in [Claude](claude.ai) for the past 24 hrs and two things are crystal clear: 

1. [Claude 3 Opus](https://www.theneurondaily.com/p/claude-3-unleashed) is as good as ChatGPT-4, if not better. 

2. **For those on the free ChatGPT, you should immediately switch to the free Claude Sonnet—it’s the best free chatbot on the market. **

* It [outperformed](https://twitter.com/KevinAFischer/status/1765045718627365034) all experts in understanding a quantum physics paper.

**Second, its writing talent is unmatched.**

It’s the most concise, [human-feeling](https://every.to/napkin-math/claude-3-is-the-most-human-ai-yet), and creative AI yet, making it great for creative writing tasks like [poems](https://twitter.com/RubenHssd/status/1765053952633020419) and [jokes](https://twitter.com/IntuitMachine/status/1764819847630786893) (kinda), and to learn from.

**Claude can help you mimic any writing style, whether it's emails, blogs, memos, 1-pagers, scripts, or press releases.**

Here’s how:

1. Feed Claude 5+ samples of your writing (it's great at learning from examples).

2. Have Claude break down the vibes of your samples.

3. Lay out what you want—be it an outline, a rough first go, or some content needing a makeover.

Use this prompt idea from our buddy Ben—just remember to feed Claude multiple samples and tag them (i.e., for each sample, put “” at the beginning and “” at the end):

Other golden rules for writing with Claude:

* Review and edit any generated content for errors. 

* Provide feedback to Claude for revisions and incorporate this into new prompts. 

* In general, Claude shines at:

  * Summarizing long-form content into concise snippets.

* Rephrasing or simplifying complex language.

* Adapting to different [languages](https://twitter.com/EphraimDuncan_/status/1765017240934478291) and dialects.

 OPENAI AND ELON MUSK (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has released a statement detailing its mission and facts about
the company's relationship with Elon Musk. The company plans to
dismiss all of the claims from Musk's recent lawsuit. OpenAI partnered
with Microsoft as it realized that it needed a lot more capital to
succeed at its mission of achieving Artificial General Intelligence.
It continues to advance its mission by building widely-available
beneficial tools. OpenAI's statement includes an email exchange
between Musk and OpenAI regarding funding. 

 IOS 17.4 IS HERE AND READY FOR A WHOLE NEW EUROPE (4 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Apple's iOS 17.4 update introduces new emojis, a cryptographic
security protocol for iMessage, major changes to the App Store and
contactless payments for the iPhone platform in Europe, the ability
for users to download alternative browser engines, and auto-generated
audio transcripts in the Podcasts app. Third-party developers will be
allowed to offer alternative marketplaces and app downloads to EU
users from outside the iOS App Store. While Apple was previously
planning to drop support for progressive web apps, it now says it will
continue to offer existing capabilities using WebKit technology, with
no option for them to be powered by third-party browser engines.

 Nvidia's B200 AI accelerator will consume 1,000 watts without
requiring liquid cooling. The chip isn't expected to launch until late
2024. Nvidia plans to launch its H200 GPUs in the next few months. The
company claims the H200 can double the performance of large language

 The Apple Vision Pro's $3,500 price tag would be much easier to
justify if it managed to replace multiple devices at once, just like
the iPhone did when it first arrived. It is possible to get serious
work done while wearing the Vision Pro - if you can work on an iPad,
you can work on a Vision Pro. However, it can't replace a Mac for
everyone due to lacking some heavy-duty applications. One big downside
is the lack of a practical way to use the Vision Pro in meetings.

 TRAINING GREAT LLMS ENTIRELY FROM GROUND ZERO IN THE WILDERNESS AS A
STARTUP (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Training AI models requires compute, but there's a large amount of
instability and huge variance in the quality of clusters,
accelerators, and connectivity in compute providers. This article
discusses the differences between training models at Google and
training models 'in the wild' - outside of Google, where data
scientists have to use GPUs instead of Google's TPUs. It makes
comparisons between Google's infrastructure and tools to their
equivalents in the outside world. With the right amount of brute
technical strength, it is possible to train models from scratch that
match Gemini Pro/GPT 3.5.

 LINUX MARKET SHARE PASSES 4% FOR FIRST TIME; MACOS DOMINANCE DECLINES
(3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Linux reached 4.03% of global market share in February. It only
recently hit the 3% milestone in June last year. Windows has seen an
increase in usage, but macOS has seen a drop in its market share,
despite its global computer market share going up in the same period.
Windows and macOS represent 87.59% of desktop OSes. 

 BITCOIN ROCKETS TO AN ALL-TIME HIGH ABOVE $69,000, SURPASSING 2021
RECORD (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high for the first time in more
than two years. It surpassed $69,000 before retreating - the previous
record was $68,982.20 on November 10, 2021. The current rally is
fueled by excitement over bitcoin ETFs and the upcoming halving event.
While investors are cautious about a possible correction, there are
still longer-term catalysts supporting the positive price action.

#### 🪖 [_U.S Army explores GPT-4 as a battle adviser_](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2420184-us-army-tests-ai-chatbots-as-battle-planners-in-a-war-game-simulation/)

**The Rundown: **The US Army Research Lab is reportedly [testing](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2420184-us-army-tests-ai-chatbots-as-battle-planners-in-a-war-game-simulation/) commercial AI chatbots like GPT-4 as battlefield planning assistants in war game simulations.

**The details: **

* In an experiment, AI chatbots proposed battle plans for a war scenario in the game StarCraft II.

* OpenAI's GPT-4 outperformed other AI models tested, though they were still imperfect.

* The DoD has identified a whopping 180 possible military uses for AI, working with copmpanies like Palantir and Scale AI to integrate the tech.

* Experts caution against using AI for military decisions, citing feasibility and ethical/bias concerns.

**Why it matters: **While AI’s integration in warfare is unavoidable, its use on the battlefield still raises troubling ethical and moral questions. But as the AI arms race heats up between global powers, the pressure to deploy the tech to gain a military advantage will only grow — whether or not it is truly ready for use.

**The Rundown: **Stability AI just partnered with Tripo AI to [release](https://stability.ai/news/triposr-3d-generation) TripoSR, a new state-of-the-art model that generates near-instant, high-quality 3D objects from a single image.

**The details: **

* TripoSR uses an AI system with millions of parameters to analyze a 2D image and predict a 3D representation of the object.

* The model was trained on a massive dataset of nearly 1M 3D objects, including both synthetic renderings and real-world captures.

* TripoSR runs efficiently without requiring a high-end GPU, making it widely accessible for use in design, gaming, AR/VR, and beyond.

**Why it matters: **With its impressive speed and quality, TripoSR represents a major leap forward in AI-powered 3D creation. By enabling nearly instant generations from a single photo, the tech could revolutionize workflows and empower more creators to bring their visions to life in 3D.** **

**The Rundown:** Anthropic just released Claude 3, setting new industry benchmarks across a wide range of tasks. 

**Here are a couple of tests we ran for **[**Claude 3**](https://claude.ai/)** (Opus) vs. **[**ChatGPT**](https://chat.openai.com/)** (GPT-4):**

* **Content writing: **When asked the question, “Write a blog post about the benefits of traveling to other countries,” Claude responded more naturally and less robotically than ChatGPT.

* **Coding an app: **When the task was to code a colorful currency converter app, Claude did a better job in following the instructions and making it colorful. ChatGPT’s app was functional but very plain.

* **Math:** It’s well-known that LLMs are not good with prime numbers. Surprisingly, ChatGPT answered correctly when asked “Is 29593 a prime number?”, while Claude did not.

* **Creative writing:** “Write ten sentences that end with ‘th’”. ChatGPT did 4 out of 10 correctly, while Claude got right 5 out of 10.

**The Rundown: **Trust in AI tool companies has dropped significantly worldwide in recent years, according to a newly released 2024 Trust Barometer [study](https://www.edelman.com/sites/g/files/aatuss191/files/2024-03/2024%20Edelman%20Trust%20Barometer%20Key%20Insights%20Around%20AI.pdf).

**The details:**

* Responses show a stark 26-point gap between high trust in the overall tech industry (76%) and much lower trust in AI specifically (50%).

* AI trust in the U.S. plummeted by 15 points from 2019 to just 35%, while global numbers fell 8 points to 53%.

* AI concerns centered on privacy, devaluing humanity, societal harm, and lack of regulation — not job displacement as often assumed.

**Why it matters: **Despite AI accelerating faster than ever, the public’s trust in the industry is going in the complete opposite direction. How AI leaders respond and adapt to negative mainstream sentiment will shape the trajectory of mass adoption in the years ahead.

**Our Report:** Anthropic (founded by ex-OpenAI employees and backed by Google) has released Claude 3—a series of Large Language Models (LLMs)— claiming it outperforms OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini. 

🔑 **Key Points:**

* Unlike Claude 2, Claude 3 **responds to text and up to 20 image inputs in a single request** (it only produces text responses, due to a lack of Enterprise demand for images).

* It processes data quicker and understands more context, meaning it **answers more questions (accurately), understands longer instructions, and gives near-instantaneous results**.

* It has **better reasoning, complex task comprehension, and graduate-level knowledge than GPT-4**, scoring 50% in tests vs GPT-4’s 36%, demonstrating near-human capability.

* It’s been **trained (using hardware from Amazon and Google) on non-public internal and third-party datasets and publicly available data** collected after August 2023. 

🤨 **Why you should care:** Following Google’s decision to disable its image generator due to historical misinterpretations, Anthropic has stopped Claude 3 from identifying people, showing awareness for potential bias and hallucinations, and respect for ethical and legal implications.

### 💬 _[New “read aloud” ChatGPT feature](https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090500/chatgpt-openai-voice-ios-android)_ 

* OpenAI **has released a new feature called “Read Aloud” **which allows users to listen to the chatbot's response to their prompt, rather than read it themselves. 

* The new feature can **speak 37 languages, has five different voice options to choose from, and can automatically detect the language of the text** it’s reading.

* It’s now **available to all ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4.0 users** on both the web version of ChatGPT and the iOS and Android ChatGPT apps, for no extra cost.

* This follows the release of the voice chat feature, which allows users to verbally prompt the chatbot (vs typing), with both features marking **a significant step forward in accessibility**.

* AMD has hit a major **US government roadblock in its efforts to sell an advanced AI chip**, which was designed and built specifically for the Chinese market.

* AMD designed its new chip to have a lower performance than the chips it sells to countries outside of China, **to try and meet US export regulations and restrictions.**

* But **US officials have said it’s still too powerful and they must obtain a license **from Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security before they can sell it to China.

* This comes after the **US planned to halt advanced AI chip shipments to China** to stop Beijing from using cutting-edge US technology to strengthen its military operations.

* When Madonna sings the 1980s hit “_La Isla Bonita_” on her concert tour, she **uses a text-to-video tool **to create moving images of swirling, sunset clouds on the arena screens.

* They originally created the effect using CGI, but Madonna felt it was too bland, so they **used Runway, a text-to-video tool rivaling OpenAI’s Sora **(not yet publically available). 

* This comes after AI video experts say the **emerging text-to-video technology could irreversibly change the entertainment industry**, putting thousands out of work.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC CLAUDE 3 (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic has trained three new models in the Claude 3 family, the
strongest of which matches GPT4’s reported benchmark results. It is
also a multimodal model and performs well on vision tasks.
Importantly, Claude's coding ability is substantially improved with
this release. 

 CHATGPT CAN READ ITS ANSWERS OUT LOUD (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI introduced a Read Aloud feature for ChatGPT, allowing it to
verbally respond to users in 37 languages with five voice options and
enhancing its multimodal capabilities and usability for on-the-go
interactions across web and mobile platforms. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 SUPPORTING LONGER CONTEXT LENGTH IN LLMS (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers have developed a new technique called Resonance RoPE to
help LLMs better understand and generate text in longer sequences than
they were originally trained on. This method, which improves on the
existing Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) system, enhances model
performance on long texts without extra computing effort. 

 UNDERSTANDING OBJECT RELATIONS IN IMAGES (28 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The All-Seeing Project V2 introduces the ASMv2 model, which blends
text generation, object localization, and understanding the
connections between objects in images. 

 A NEW COMPLEX BENCHMARK FOR AI SYSTEMS (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A new dataset called GPQA presents a real challenge with 448 tough
multiple-choice questions in biology, physics, and chemistry. Even
domain experts struggle, scoring around 65% accuracy, while
non-experts only manage 34%. Advanced AI systems like GPT-4 achieve
just 39% accuracy. This dataset is aimed at developing methods for
supervising AI outputs in complex scientific questions.

 CLAUDE 3 OPUS FOR VIDEO SUMMARIZATION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Andrej Karpathy issued a long context challenge to make a blog post
from a recent video of his. Claude 3 was able to perform this task
with some data pre-processing help. The resulting blog post is high
quality and interesting. 

 ENHANCED IMAGE RESTORATION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Dual-domain strip attention mechanism is a new method that
significantly improves image restoration tasks. 

 OPEN SORA PLAN (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This project aims to reproduce OpenAI’s text-to-video model Sora.
It is currently building out the basic components and searching for
interested open-source contributors to assist. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 ENHANCING MODELS’ CONFIDENCE WITH SURE (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 SURE is a novel method that combines various techniques to improve
the reliability of uncertainty predictions in deep neural networks,
especially for image classification tasks. 

 AGGREGATOR’S AI RISK (18 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The influence of the printing press on the dissemination of
information and the formation of nation-states mirrors the impact of
the Internet, particularly through Aggregators like Google and Meta.
However, the emergence of generative AI challenges the Aggregator
model by providing singular answers that reflect embedded worldviews,
potentially undermining the universal appeal that underpins Aggregator
economics and suggesting a shift towards personalized AI to maintain
their dominance. 

 IS SYNTHETIC DATA THE KEY TO AGI? (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The effectiveness of large language models is primarily influenced by
the quality of their training data. Projections suggest that
high-quality data will be scarce by 2027. Synthetic data generation
emerges as a promising solution to this challenge, potentially
reshaping internet business models and highlighting the importance of
equitable data access and antitrust considerations.

Welcome, humans. 

There’s a fascinating [debate](https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1764408581405982988) on Twitter about whether AI should _actually_ be considered as dangerous nukes, or if it’s essentially just “powerful math”. 

Our take? We're crossing our fingers that AI isn't a civilization-ending threat like nuclear weapons (we're not keen on relocating to Los Alamos for coverage), and honestly, it's not that great at math either… :)

**Here’s what you need to know about AI today:**

* Anthropic released a significantly upgraded Claude 3.

* Arc Browser is a new AI search engine with 100K+ daily users. 

* 56% of Neuron readers want _more_ AI in customer support. 

* ChatGPT can now read its output aloud to you.

There are three versions of the model, and each is way smarter and more responsive than Claude 2:

1. Haiku is the fastest. 

2. **Sonnet powers the **_**free**_** Claude 3—this is *THE BEST* free AI chatbot available.**

3. Opus powers Claude Pro, available at $20/month.

We played around with Claude 3 all of yesterday—here's our updated guidance on when to use it:

**For formal/creative writing, use Claude 3.** We literally write for a living—Claude 3 is now the best for crafting emails, drafts, memos, summaries, & more. It’s concise, nuanced, and [human-like](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1764743203490509107).

Claude 3 gives super creative responses for our entire bank of content creation prompts we use for testing.

**ChatGPT-4 for data analysis. **Although Claude 3 can handle a larger context limit of 200K (and 1M for select customers), it slipped up on numbers and didn’t design charts/graphs as well. 

**Claude 3 for coding (maybe).** [Some](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39590666) users report Claude 3 outperforms GPT-4 and specialized models like Grimoire in coding tasks, but detailed comparisons are TBD. 

Additional insights:

* Claude 3’s speed is standard, but slows down significantly during lengthy convos. 

* To build w/, Claude Opus is more expensive than GPT, but Sonnet and Haiku are cheaper ([breakdown](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/4/claude-3/)).

* The knowledge cutoff is [August 2023](https://twitter.com/MimansaJ/status/1764668730926366972) so be wary of any questions relying on info since then (it’s not connected to the Internet).

* You can compare all of these models on [Poe](https://poe.com/Claude-3-Opus?utm_source=theneuron).

Final thoughts:

1. **We’re not saying ditch ChatGPT**—instead, compare the tools to find which best suits your needs (we plan to use both).

2. OpenAI might be sitting on a big ChatGPT upgrade, and now would be a good time to release it.

3. AI models are being commoditized (i.e. there won’t be one clear winner).

 THE AI WARS HEAT UP WITH CLAUDE 3, CLAIMED TO HAVE “NEAR-HUMAN”
ABILITIES (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic's Claude 3 apparently sets new industry benchmarks across a
range of cognitive tasks. The company claims that it approaches
'near-human' capability in some cases. Claude 3 has three models:
Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3 Sonnet (which powers the Claude.ai chatbot),
and Claude 3 Opus (available through a subscription service). All
three models feature a 200,000-token context window and are available
through an API. Claude 3 beats GPT-4 on a range of widely used
benchmarks.

 THE HUNT FOR THE MISSING DATA TYPE (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 While developers see graphs everywhere and use them to analyze all
sorts of systems, there is almost no graph support in any mainstream
language. This is because there are too many different kinds of
graphs, representations of each kind of graph, and graph algorithms.
Also, graph algorithm performance is very sensitive to graph
representation and implementation details. Languages don't support
graphs in their standard libraries because there are too many design
decisions and tradeoffs and too much maintenance burden. This also
explains why programmers avoid third-party graph libraries - they're
either too limited to too slow.

 GOOGLE CO-FOUNDER SERGEY BRIN SAYS IN RARE PUBLIC APPEARANCE THAT
COMPANY ‘DEFINITELY MESSED UP’ GEMINI IMAGE LAUNCH (7 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Alphabet co-founder Sergey Brin, who came out of retirement to work
on AI, spoke to a group of artificial intelligence enthusiasts over
the weekend at the 'AGI House' in Hillsborough, California, about AI's
impact on search and how Google might maintain its leadership position
as AI continues to grow. Brin commented on the launch of Google's
image generator, saying that the company messed up due to a lack of
thorough testing. He also spoke about other topics such as virtual and
augmented reality hardware and Gemini's potential impact on products
like Google Maps and Street View. 

 AGGREGATOR’S AI RISK (27 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Internet made publishing and distribution zero marginal cost
activities. It created a new world of abundance, but it also created a
new type of power given to those who had the ability to make sense of
that abundance. Allowing anyone to publish didn't further decentralize
power - new powers emerged to control discovery. Generative AI flips
that paradigm around, collapsing all published knowledge into a single
answer. This answer is unlikely to make everyone happy. A potential
solution to this problem is to personalize AIs so they do a better job
of giving people what they want to see.

**The Rundown: **Anthropic just [announced](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family) the release of its next-generation Claude 3 model family, with the top-tier ‘Opus’ version outperforming top models like GPT-4 and Gemini Ultra across major benchmarks. 

**The details:**

* The Claude 3 lineup consists of Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku, each offering different levels of capability, speed, and cost.

* Opus outperforms GPT-4 and Gemini Ultra on benchmarks, including expert knowledge, reasoning, coding, and mathematics.

* Claude 3 also claims new vision capabilities on par with leading models like GPT-4V.

* Opus displays a near-perfect 99% recall ability on processing long context prompts.

* All three models boast a 200k context window (with the ability to handle as high as 1M).

* Claude has removed the waitlist for API usage, allowing builders to immediately integrate the enhanced new models.

**Why it matters: **Gemini and ChatGPT may have gotten all the headlines in 2024, but Claude just came out of nowhere to claim the top of the AI benchmark leaderboards. We’ll be sharing the results from The Rundown’s Claude 3 vs. GPT-4 tests shortly — stay tuned!

**The Rundown: **Pop icon Madonna has become an early adopter of AI-generated video technology, reportedly [leveraging](https://apnews.com/article/ai-video-generators-runway-sora-madonna-4e21021b9db8a45a9897d9285f394687) Runway’s platform to create visual effects for her ongoing Celebration Tour.

**The details: **

* Madonna's team experimented with AI text-to-video to generate moving images for her performance of "La Isla Bonita."

* The AI-generated visuals replaced earlier CGI attempts that were deemed "bland and cheesy".

* Runway CEO Cristobal Valenzuela [said](https://x.com/c_valenzuelab/status/1764680055442309483?s=20) that musicians A$AP Rocky, Kanye West, and Slash have also utilized Runway.

**Why it matters: **Between Runway’s growing adoption and Sora’s viral teasers, the AI video wave is coming fast. And while initial sentiment was overwhelmingly negative towards AI, some artists seem to be coming around to the idea of AI as a tool rather than a replacement.
