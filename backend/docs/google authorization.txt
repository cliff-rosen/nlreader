Google Authorization

BASIC FLOW

1. React embeds authorization URL in a link
2. User clicks authorization URL and completes flow
3. Browser is redirected to auth callback (react) with auth code
4. Auth callback bookmarks current route and sends auth code to Flask, which:
- exchanges auth code for google access token
- encodes google access token in its own JWT
- returns JWT to browser
5. Auth callback stores JWT in local storage and renavigates to bookmarked route

API CALLS FROM Browser

1. Browser retrieves JWT from local storage
2. JWT is sent as Bearer to Flask
3. Flask decodes the JWT to creds
4. If creds valid, Flask builds service with creds and makes API call
If creds needs refresh, Flask uses refresh token to update creds and then makes API call
